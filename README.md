# debtoo-scripts
Scripts designed for Debtoo - my own Linux distro.

# Requirements
In order to use these scripts, you'll need:
  - Debian (or a Debian-based distro)
  - A working internet connection
  - (debtoo-install) root privileges
 
 For debtoo-install, you'll also need to install the following dependencies if you haven't already:
  - parted
  - iputils-ping
  - debootstrap
  - arch-install-scripts
  - gawk
  - dosfstools and efibootmgr (for installation on UEFI systems)
